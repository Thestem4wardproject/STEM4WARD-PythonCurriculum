The pigeon 2.0 is a gyroscope, which means it gives the robot the ability to tell which way it is facing.

Some key things to know are:

 - Should be fed 12v 2amp from a VRM
 - Should be kept as flat to the ground and as close to the center of the robot as possible
 - Should be facing towards the front of the robot
