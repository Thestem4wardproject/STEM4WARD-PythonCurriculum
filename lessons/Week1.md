# Week 1: Your First Python Adventure üêç

Welcome to coding! Today you're going to learn Python, one of the coolest programming languages out there.

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that's used to build tons of stuff you probably use every day:
- Instagram and YouTube 
- Netflix recommendations
- Video games
- Apps on your phone

The best part? Python is super beginner-friendly, so you'll be writing real code today!

## Getting Started with Replit

We'll be using Replit to write our Python code. Think of it like Google Docs, but for coding. Everything saves automatically and you can access your projects from anywhere.

**Your first task:** Go to replit.com and create your account if you haven't already.

## Your First Program: Hello World!

Every programmer writes their first "Hello World" program. It's like a tradition! Here's how you do it in Python:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Type that into your Replit and hit the green "Run" button. Boom! You just wrote your first program.

**Try this:** Change "Hello World!" to something else. Maybe your name, your favorite food, or even "I am awesome at coding!"

## Python as a Super Calculator

One of the first things you'll notice about Python is that it's amazing at math. You can use it like a really smart calculator.

Here are the math symbols Python understands:
- `+` for adding
- `-` for subtracting  
- `*` for multiplying
- `/` for dividing

Try these out in your Replit:

```python
print(5 + 3)
print(10 - 4)
print(6 * 7)
print(100 / 5)
```

**Challenge:** Can you figure out what `15 // 4` does? Or `15 % 4`? Try them and see!

## Making Your Code Make Sense

As you write more code, you'll want to remember what different parts do. That's where comments come in handy. In Python, anything after a `#` is a comment - Python ignores it, but it helps you remember what you were thinking.

```python
print("This code runs")
# This is a comment - Python ignores this line
print(5 + 3)  # You can also put comments at the end of lines
```

## Important Python Rules

Python is pretty chill, but it has a few rules you need to follow:

1. **Spelling matters:** `print` works, but `Print` doesn't
2. **Parentheses matter:** `print("hello")` works, `print "hello"` doesn't
3. **Quotes matter:** Text needs to be in quotes like `"this"`

Don't worry if you make mistakes - every programmer does! Python will tell you when something's wrong.

## Practice Time!

Here's what you're going to build today:

**Create a program that:**
1. Says hello to you by name
2. Tells us your favorite number
3. Does some math with that number (add, subtract, multiply, or divide it by something)
4. Has at least 3 comments explaining what your code does

**Example:**
```python
# This program is about me!
print("Hi, I'm Alex")
print("My favorite number is 7")

# Let me do some math with my favorite number
print(7 * 2)  # My favorite number times 2
print(7 + 10) # My favorite number plus 10
```

## What's Next?

Great job on your first day of coding! Next week we'll learn about variables - a way to store information so your programs can remember things and get even more awesome.

## Need Help?

Stuck on something? Here are some quick fixes:
- **Nothing happens when you run:** Make sure you have `print()` around what you want to see
- **Red error text:** Check your spelling and make sure you have quotes around text
- **Can't find the run button:** It's the big green triangle at the top

Remember: making mistakes is how you learn to code. Every error is just Python helping you get better!
