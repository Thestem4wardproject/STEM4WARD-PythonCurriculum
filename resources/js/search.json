[[{"l":"Readme"}],[{"l":"Week 1: Your First Python Adventure \uD83D\uDC0D","p":["Welcome to coding! Today you're going to learn Python, one of the coolest programming languages out there."]},{"l":"What is Python?","p":["Python is a programming language that's used to build tons of stuff you probably use every day:","Instagram and YouTube","Netflix recommendations","Video games","Apps on your phone","The best part? Python is super beginner-friendly, so you'll be writing real code today!"]},{"l":"Getting Started with Replit","p":["We'll be using Replit to write our Python code. Think of it like Google Docs, but for coding. Everything saves automatically and you can access your projects from anywhere.","Your first task: Go to replit.com and create your account if you haven't already."]},{"l":"Your First Program: Hello World!","p":["Every programmer writes their first \"Hello World\" program. It's like a tradition! Here's how you do it in Python:","Type that into your Replit and hit the green \"Run\" button. Boom! You just wrote your first program.","Try this: Change \"Hello World!\" to something else. Maybe your name, your favorite food, or even \"I am awesome at coding!\""]},{"l":"Python as a Super Calculator","p":["One of the first things you'll notice about Python is that it's amazing at math. You can use it like a really smart calculator.","Here are the math symbols Python understands:","+ for adding","- for subtracting","* for multiplying","/ for dividing","Try these out in your Replit:","Challenge: Can you figure out what 15 // 4 does? Or 15 % 4? Try them and see!"]},{"l":"Making Your Code Make Sense","p":["As you write more code, you'll want to remember what different parts do. That's where comments come in handy. In Python, anything after a # is a comment - Python ignores it, but it helps you remember what you were thinking."]},{"l":"Important Python Rules","p":["Python is pretty chill, but it has a few rules you need to follow:","Spelling matters: print works, but Print doesn't","Parentheses matter: print(hello) works, print hello doesn't","Quotes matter: Text needs to be in quotes like this","Don't worry if you make mistakes - every programmer does! Python will tell you when something's wrong."]},{"l":"Practice Time!","p":["Here's what you're going to build today:","Create a program that:","Says hello to you by name","Tells us your favorite number","Does some math with that number (add, subtract, multiply, or divide it by something)","Has at least 3 comments explaining what your code does","Example:"]},{"l":"What's Next?","p":["Great job on your first day of coding! Next week we'll learn about variables - a way to store information so your programs can remember things and get even more awesome."]},{"l":"Need Help?","p":["Stuck on something? Here are some quick fixes:","Nothing happens when you run: Make sure you have print() around what you want to see","Red error text: Check your spelling and make sure you have quotes around text","Can't find the run button: It's the big green triangle at the top","Remember: making mistakes is how you learn to code. Every error is just Python helping you get better!"]}],[{"l":"Week 2: Making Your Programs Interactive \uD83D\uDCAC","p":["Last week you learned how to make Python print things. This week, we're going to make your programs way cooler by letting them talk back to you!"]},{"l":"Getting Input from Users","p":["Remember how you could only make Python say the same thing every time? That's about to change. Meet the input() function - it lets your program ask questions and wait for answers.","Try this:","Cool, right? But there's a problem - Python asks the question and then... forgets your answer. That's where variables come in!"]},{"l":"Variables: Python's Memory","p":["Think of variables like labeled boxes where Python can store information. Once you put something in a variable, Python remembers it until you change it or your program ends.","Here's how to create a variable:","The = sign doesn't mean \"equals\" like in math. It means \"store this value in this variable.\" So name = input(What's your name? ) means \"ask for the user's name and store their answer in a box labeled 'name'.\"","Try this: Create a program that asks for your favorite color and then tells you something cool about that color."]},{"l":"Different Types of Information","p":["Python is pretty smart about different types of information. Let's learn about the three main types:"]},{"l":"Strings (Text)","p":["Anything in quotes is a string - letters, numbers, symbols, whatever:"]},{"l":"Integers (Whole Numbers)","p":["These are regular counting numbers:"]},{"l":"Floats (Decimal Numbers)","p":["Numbers with decimal points:"]},{"l":"The input() Trick","p":["Here's something important: input() ALWAYS gives you back a string, even if someone types a number.","Try this and see what happens:","Did you get an error? That's because Python can't add a string (like \"13\") to a number (like 1). They're different types!"]},{"l":"Converting Types","p":["Don't worry - Python has tools to fix this. You can convert between types:","Or you can do it all in one line:","The conversion functions:","int()- converts to whole numbers","float()- converts to decimal numbers","str()- converts to text"]},{"l":"Making Dynamic Messages","p":["Now you can create programs that feel personal! Instead of printing the same thing every time, you can use variables to make custom messages:","You can also use variables in math:"]},{"l":"Practice Challenge: Personal Calculator","p":["Create a program that:","Asks for your name","Asks for two numbers","Adds those numbers together","Tells you the result using your name","Example run:","Bonus challenges:","Make it do subtraction, multiplication, or division too","Ask for their age and tell them how old they'll be in 10 years","Ask for the number of pets they have and tell them something fun about it"]},{"l":"Common Mistakes (Don't Worry, Everyone Makes These!)","p":["\"I can't add my numbers!\"","Remember: input() gives you strings, use int() to convert them","\"I get weird error messages\"","Check if you're trying to add strings and numbers together","Make sure you have quotes around text: hello not hello","\"My variable disappeared\"","Variables only exist inside your program - when it ends, they're gone","Make sure you spelled the variable name exactly the same way"]},{"l":"Why Variables Are Awesome","p":["Variables make your code:","Reusable: You can use the same value multiple times","Readable: name is clearer than Sarah scattered everywhere","Flexible: Change one variable and it updates everywhere"]},{"l":"What's Coming Next Week?","p":["Next week we'll learn about making decisions in your code - teaching Python to choose different paths based on what the user tells it. Get ready for if statements!"]},{"l":"Quick Reference"}]]
