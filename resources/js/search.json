[[{"l":"Readme"}],[{"l":"Week 1: Your First Python Adventure \uD83D\uDC0D","p":["Welcome to coding! Today you're going to learn Python, one of the coolest programming languages out there."]},{"l":"What is Python?","p":["Python is a programming language that's used to build tons of stuff you probably use every day:","Instagram and YouTube","Netflix recommendations","Video games","Apps on your phone","The best part? Python is super beginner-friendly, so you'll be writing real code today!"]},{"l":"Getting Started with Replit","p":["We'll be using Replit to write our Python code. Think of it like Google Docs, but for coding. Everything saves automatically and you can access your projects from anywhere.","Your first task: Go to replit.com and create your account if you haven't already."]},{"l":"Your First Program: Hello World!","p":["Every programmer writes their first \"Hello World\" program. It's like a tradition! Here's how you do it in Python:","Type that into your Replit and hit the green \"Run\" button. Boom! You just wrote your first program.","Try this: Change \"Hello World!\" to something else. Maybe your name, your favorite food, or even \"I am awesome at coding!\""]},{"l":"Python as a Super Calculator","p":["One of the first things you'll notice about Python is that it's amazing at math. You can use it like a really smart calculator.","Here are the math symbols Python understands:","+ for adding","- for subtracting","* for multiplying","/ for dividing","Try these out in your Replit:","Challenge: Can you figure out what 15 // 4 does? Or 15 % 4? Try them and see!"]},{"l":"Making Your Code Make Sense","p":["As you write more code, you'll want to remember what different parts do. That's where comments come in handy. In Python, anything after a # is a comment - Python ignores it, but it helps you remember what you were thinking."]},{"l":"Important Python Rules","p":["Python is pretty chill, but it has a few rules you need to follow:","Spelling matters: print works, but Print doesn't","Parentheses matter: print(hello) works, print hello doesn't","Quotes matter: Text needs to be in quotes like this","Don't worry if you make mistakes - every programmer does! Python will tell you when something's wrong."]},{"l":"Practice Time!","p":["Here's what you're going to build today:","Create a program that:","Says hello to you by name","Tells us your favorite number","Does some math with that number (add, subtract, multiply, or divide it by something)","Has at least 3 comments explaining what your code does","Example:"]},{"l":"What's Next?","p":["Great job on your first day of coding! Next week we'll learn about variables - a way to store information so your programs can remember things and get even more awesome."]},{"l":"Need Help?","p":["Stuck on something? Here are some quick fixes:","Nothing happens when you run: Make sure you have print() around what you want to see","Red error text: Check your spelling and make sure you have quotes around text","Can't find the run button: It's the big green triangle at the top","Remember: making mistakes is how you learn to code. Every error is just Python helping you get better!"]}]]
