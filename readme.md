Hello! Welcome to the FRC team ALARM Robotics's personal electrical documentation. Take a look at our component docs to quickly check for a wire gauge or specification, or our basic electrical standards to see what to do for a robot, or even learn basic electrical with our zero to hero guide. 

Hope you enjoy!
